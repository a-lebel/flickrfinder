# What is Flick Finder

FlickFinder is a React and Redux application designed to help users discover and search for movies. Users can search by various criteria such as genre, year, or actors and view detailed information about each movie. The app also features a "Random Pick of the Day" to suggest a movie if the user is unsure what to watch.

## Key Features

Home Page

Search Bar: A single input field where users can type keywords (genre, year, or actor) to search for movies.
Random Pick of the Day: Displays a randomly selected movie with an image, title, and a link to view more details.
Search Results Page

Displays movies in a grid format with images, titles, and short descriptions.
New Search Button: Takes the user back to the home page.
Load More Button: Loads additional movie results in increments of 8.
Movie Details Page

Shows detailed information about the selected movie, including title, description, actors, year, and IMDb rating.
Where to Watch: Lists platforms where the movie is available.
Back to Results Button: Returns to the previous search results.

## Tools

The UI design was made in Figma, and the app was developed in VS code.

## Future improvements

* Add a filter function in the search results
* Add a "Randomize again" button in the random pick so the user can get another option.
* Link the movie page to the platform listed.
* Posibility of watching the trailer of each movie.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
